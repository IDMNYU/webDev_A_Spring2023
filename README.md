#### [Course Schedule](schedule.md) and [Course wiki](https://github.com/IDMNYU/webDev_A_Spring2023/wiki)


#### Course Description:
This section of 2193 is an introduction to front end programming through the lens of visual culture. Students are asked to think critically about contemporary imaging + networking tools, techniques and practices while experimenting with interactive media. The semester is scheduled in sequence for an incremental understanding of contemporary web authoring practices. Using the web browser as a creative tool, students will explore responsive web development becoming familiar with: the [unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command line, Git, Github + Github pages, and the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Students will create and maintain websites that take into consideration aesthetic quality, user experience and technical expertise.

#### IDM Program Learning Objectives:
Students will:
1. Develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
2. Develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
3. Develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic + technological contexts.
4. Gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking + career preparation.
5. Develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

#### Course Objectives:
* Web Development Workflow Including a local HTTP Server
* Unix Bash shell 
* User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)
* HTML5 / CSS3
* The Responsive Web (flexible media & media queries)
* EcmaScript 6 (JavaScript)

#### Student Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Become comfortable with discomfort by proactively learning - querying the web to research open source tools + documentation
2. Practice effective digital hygeine including navigating system file paths
3. Design, build, and develop assets for a professional quality front end websites
4. Use the Github workflow while using Github Pages to publish and maintain sites
5. Feel comfortable participating in discussions, presenting research and work to the class using the HDMI connection, collaborate successfully on code projects, learn skills to create their own developer / creative communities

#### Course Structure:
Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, discussion, in class exercises, critique, user testing + student presentations. Homework will consist of weekly projects that ask students to
respond to readings, thinking critically about the cultural implications of networked technologies while building on each week‚Äôs technical material. Students should expect to build a new web page every week.

#### Required Materials:
* Students will need a laptop for class (if this is an issue, please come talk to me)
* Visual Studio Code - Text editing software
* Google Chrom Web Browser
* [Unix Bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))- Mac Terminal or Windows Bash Power Shell
* Git, Github account + Githup Pages

#### Research + Resources:
All materials for this class are open source + can be accessed via this repository and the wiki. Regular updates to the class repo will contain links to starter code gone over during class as well as links to further technical reading. Pick and choose what is of most interest to you - the repo is a jumping off point for your own research + you can always return back to a week to catch up on missed material. Additionally, students will be responsible for citing + discussing their research methods and discoveries with the class.  

* For the majority of the semester students are required to use a grainular tool kit outlined in class. This means leaning on documentation rather than pre-existing code or libraries. 

* Required Text: 
The web is a vast trove of thirty plus years worth of folks thinking they have the answer to yr coding questions. Do not belive everyone you read, nor trust that a code snippet is the be-all solution to yr project. For that reason **[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is the "textbook" for this class and should be your primary resource**. 

* Open Source vs. Plagerism:
Plagerism is strictly forbidden. If you intend to implement some one else's code you must **cite your sources**. That said, much of learning web dev from the grainular level is how you use the tools to put your puzzle together. This means what you chose to build a project about or for (the word content) become integral to its originality and your technical development. We'll discuss this more throughout the semester. 

#### ‚ÄúShare‚Äù:
The class [wiki](https://github.com/IDMNYU/webDev_D_Spring2023/wiki) - is where the rest of the syllabus including in-class and homework assignments will be found. To turn in your homework you should add a link to your work weekly using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must set up a [Github](http://www.github.com) account.

#### Readings:
Students will be asked to engage with a variety of texts from the world of art, film, philosophy, technology and
literature. Authors include: Ralph Ellison, Jon Berger, Tim Berners Lee, Shannon Mattern, Marshall McLuhan, Selma Sharif, Susan Sontag,among others. Readings will be assigned weekly, provide by the professor and accessible via the wiki as links or downloadable portable document formats.

#### Grading + Attendance Policy:
Class Participation (20% of grade): Please arrive on time having completed the assignments. Participation in class discussions, peer feedback / critique, pair programming / collaborating and user testing are not only expected, but will be reflected in your grade.

Weekly Design + Technical Exercises + Class Site + Presentations (50% of grade): will be executed through the semester by following in class demonstrations, online tutorials and assigned readings. These exercises will be essential for learning markup and coding and to successfully complete more complex projects.

Students will be expected to maintain their sites, designing reading reflections on a website built for + during class using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). We will build this site together incrementally during the first few weeks, following assignments + projects are to be added + linked to throughout the semester. **Using Github Pages to publish is mandatory.**

Pair Programming net.art presentation (10% of grade)

Final Project (20% of grade)

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technical, aesthetic and concept driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks. 

#### Qualitative Grading Overview
A. Excellent (90-100)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

C. Satisfactory (70-79)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

D. Poor Below Average (60-69)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.

#### Academic Accommodations:
If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please contact New York University‚Äôs Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.
